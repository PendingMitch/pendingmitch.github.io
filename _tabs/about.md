## <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59yGjJ0FScg" target="_blank" alt=""><img src="https://i.imgur.com/t8q2dQU.png" width="50"></a> 2CalRP

2CalRP was a gaming community that spanned over 600 members, which started in May 2021. The community grew rapidly. The main aim for this was to produce a better product from what we (the three owners) had previously experienced - namely the administrative personnel that we had encountered and their systems.

As an owner, I took the head of the development team, operated as a law enforcement supervisor and dealt with tickets within the discord server spanning over issues such as supervisor and staff complaints, ban appeals and general enquiries.

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59yGjJ0FScg) was produced by myself as a solo team in order to promote the server within the FiveM community.

The ownership was changed in April 2022. The community then failed and died out, ultimately suggesting the important role the original owners (Josh Cavalente, ZedX34, and PendingMitch - myself) had taken on. The community has since been relaunched under multiple different names including Spectrum RP and Gulf Coast RP, of which I have no affiliation to except the existing assets that still exist from 2CalRP.

## Coastal Response FiveM

Coastal Response was a gaming community that spanned over 100 members, which started in March 2023.

I took the head of the development team, operated as a law enforcement supervisor and dealt with tickets within the discord server spanning over issues such as supervisor and staff complaints, ban appeals and general enquiries.

Unfortunately, the community ceased to operate after a failure in marketing towards players and a focus of player retention was lost.

## PendingDevelopment

PendingDevelopment is a development group (of just myself) that creates high quality scripts and websites. This started in August 2022 where I seeked to create my own CAD but continued creating scripts such as PendingSound, PendingBreathalyser, PendingMedical, and PendingCameraTech.
